DFF is a software package for development and deployment of molecular force fields. It comes in two versions: Standard and Professional. The Standard version is for deployment of force fields, while the Professional version offers additional functionalities for development of new force fields. The latest version is [DFF 8](./dff8.md).

This website provides online version of DFF standard edition, [WebDFF](./webdff.md). WebDFF uses TEAMFF, a database of multiple force fields in popular functional forms, to assign force field parameters and exports the parameters to simulation software package, LAMMPS and GROMACS.
